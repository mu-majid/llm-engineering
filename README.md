Journey to learn Large Language Models (LLMs)


## Setup:
1. installed Anaconda
2. Setup the environment using environment.yml file
  - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Added my openai api key to be able to connect to openai apis.
4. Activate the conda env
  - `conda activate llms`

## Notes:
 - Frontier models have some limitations, like:
    1. Not a PhD level in some specialised domains, so an expert is still needed there.
    2. Their knowledge is cut off to a certain date.
    3. Can have blind spots and give wrong answers very confidently.
